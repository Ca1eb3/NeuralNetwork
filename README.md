# NeuralNetwork
A python package for building feed forward neural networks. The neural networks can contain any number of nodes in each layer. Each neural network has an input layer, an output layer and any number of hidden layers. Each layer can use either a sigmoid or tanh activation function. The cost function used is mean squared error. The builder class can be used to initialize a network with any number of input and output nodes and any number of hidden layers with any number of nodes per hidden layer.
